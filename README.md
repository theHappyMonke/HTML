My first (working) website

Here will contain most of the information about my approach to this project and how I tackled some of the issues I experienced during this project

As of 05/01/2024, I am researching Jinja 3 so I can properly use the index feature with flask that I have set up. So far, as of date, I have created some basic css and html code that makes the website have a gradient and that the buttons have rounded edges. I have also created a nav-bar (WIP) that functions, but it is individually on each file but I want it to be just on the index file and it imports the nav-bar to each page from the index as this will clean up the program and help it run smoother. This is why I am researching Jinja 3 because I am aware that it is possible to do the task i wish, but i need to learn how to do this. Don't know how long it will take, but i should get it working in a couple days hopefully.

It is now 12/1/2024, I have officialy made a template under the "index.html" file. it seems to work as expected and now all that is left is to work out the kinks and then add the actual content.
